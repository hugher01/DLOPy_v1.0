The equal-area dispersion maps were created using the
codes and results of Ma et al (2014) and Ma and Masters (2014)
Original Fortran routines were written by
Zhitu Ma
IGPP / SIO / UCSD
Brown University (as of April 2017)

geographiclib is a library of routines for
performing geographic calculations and solving
geodesic problems written by C. F. F. Karney.
Implementations in other languages are available
